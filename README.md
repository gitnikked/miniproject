Data Science Mini Project
The path for the dataset in the code is \\data-master\\credit-card\\creditcard.csv
Change directory of the pd.read_csv function according to where you download dataset to in relation to where Miniprojekt1.py is placed.
Should be able to do a full run, but if hiccups happen, try running it cell by cell.
Some cells take a relatively long time to proces, have patience.
When running the LinearSVC classification, an error occurs but does not affect the actual result of the classification and subsequent evaluation metrics. Ignore error message.
Plotting shows in IDE, but also is saved to .png file. It is easier to read from .png file when looking at plots, but if you don't want files to be created, comment out all plt.savefig() functions.
